Being trapped in a v disabling situation and that meaning you make mistakes because your fried and therefore those mistakes cost you support and opportunities to change the situation, a situation which isnt even safe apart from being disabling- prob in part cos it just is vile - fuck that traps like this exist burn them down - it is like when you have no physical wellbeing space it takes alot more energy to manage mood and its easier to , and often inevitable kinda to fuck up - and it stains / sits on you as a marker which people just leave ‘this weight’ on you and tour like a flattened platformer charcter with a waddle because a lead coin slab is crushing you, its not even money alone - these places shouldnt exist which is more than money - it means tearing down buildings, rerouting traffic, reconsidering gentrifying building developments that destroy space idk burn them of course it just is so small making as you are under the thumb of this place , people seem like glowering down and it isnt possible to say anything cos ____
Its the attitude of low an upbeat attitude making things better , that ‘disciplined positivity’ (?toxic) and the toxic actual bodily impact, its the impact on your body which has only so much ability to breathe and metabolise poison it is a disability which means capitalism is maddening idk, that people are disabled passively it is maddening when put next to these wealthy osified gentrified schemes which are congealed cgi money in architecture and which are mine as much it is alienating to be under the boot and noone remebers or assumes - they expect it to be a bump or swerve , that its not that bodies can be disabled or degenerated - that they are or they are not, it is in the council and god’s hands what the roads look like and your a fauna in the dead concrete , not a liver of life
It is bestialising on a dehumanising way, not a becoming in nature away from man but an unbecoming treading down under the march of progress which is mine ! I progress ! I improve ! I attempt ! I grow and change ! Not langur , boringly insane
